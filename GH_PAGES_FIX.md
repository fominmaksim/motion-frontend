# GitHub Pages Routing Fix

## 🐛 **Problem Fixed:**
The app was getting 404 errors on GitHub Pages because React Router wasn't configured for subdirectory deployment.

## ✅ **Changes Made:**

### 1. **Router Type Changed**
- From: `createBrowserRouter` (requires server-side routing)
- To: `createHashRouter` (works with static hosting like GitHub Pages)

### 2. **Vite Base Path**
- Set to: `/motion-frontend/` (matches your repository name)
- This ensures all assets load correctly

### 3. **404.html for GitHub Pages**
- Added SPA routing support
- Handles direct URL access properly

### 4. **Asset Paths Updated**
- Icon and other assets now use correct base path

## 🚀 **Deploy Again:**

```bash
# Commit the changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix GitHub Pages routing with hash router and 404.html"

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin main
```

## 🔍 **What This Fixes:**

- ✅ No more 404 errors on direct URL access
- ✅ Proper routing with hash-based URLs
- ✅ Assets load correctly from subdirectory
- ✅ Works with GitHub Pages static hosting

## 📱 **URL Format After Fix:**

- Home: `https://fominmaksim.github.io/motion-frontend/#/`
- Dashboard: `https://fominmaksim.github.io/motion-frontend/#/dashboard`
- Settings: `https://fominmaksim.github.io/motion-frontend/#/settings`

## 💡 **Why Hash Router?**

GitHub Pages serves static files, so it can't handle server-side routing. Hash routers work entirely in the browser, making them perfect for static hosting.

Your app should now work perfectly on GitHub Pages! 🎉
